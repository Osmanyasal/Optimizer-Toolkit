 * temperature of the processor. Temperature measurements returned by digital
 * thermal sensors are always at or below Thermal Control Circuitry (TCC)
 * activation temperature. Critical temperature conditions are detected using
 * the "Critical Temperature Status" bit. When this bit is set, the processor is
 * operating at a critical temperature and immediate shutdown of the system
 * should occur. Once the "Critical Temperature Status" bit is set, reliable
 * operation is not guaranteed.
 * 0x19C 0x00000000F87F0FFF
 * Thermal Status (bit 0):
    This bit indicates whether the digital thermal sensor high-temperature
    output signal (PROCHOT#) is currently active. Bit 0 = 1 indicates the

    state of the digital thermal sensor.
 * Thermal Status Log (bit 1):
    This is a sticky bit that indicates the history of the thermal sensor high
    temperature output signal (PROCHOT#). Bit 1 = 1 if PROCHOT# has been

    Digital Readout, bits 22:16.
 * Thermal Threshold #2 Log (bit 9):
    Sticky bit that indicates whether the Thermal Threshold #2 has been reached
    since the last clearing of this bit or a reset. If bit 9 = 1, the Thermal
    Threshold #2 has been reached. Software may clear this bit by writing a

    - 1: (TCC Activation - 1) , etc. See the processor's data sheet for details
    regarding TCC activation.
    A lower reading in the Digital Readout field (bits 22:16) indicates a higher
    actual temperature.
 * Reserved (bits 26:23)
 * Resolution in Deg. Celsius (bits 30:27):
    Specifies the resolution (or tolerance) of the digital thermal sensor. The
    value is in degrees Celsius. It is recommended that new threshold values be

 * IA32_PACKAGE_THERM_STATUS and IA32_PACKAGE_THERM_INTERRUPT MSRs use similar
 * interfaces as IA32_THERM_STATUS and IA32_THERM_INTERRUPT, but are shared in
 * each physical processor package.
 * Software can enumerate the presence of the processor's support for package
 * level thermal management facility (IA32_PACKAGE_THERM_STATUS and
 * IA32_PACKAGE_THERM_INTERRUPT) by verifying CPUID.06H:EAX[bit 6] = 1.
 * 0x1B1 0x00000000007F0FFF
 * PKG Thermal Status (bit 0):
    This bit indicates whether the digital thermal sensor high-temperature
    output signal (PROCHOT#) for the package is currently active. Bit 0 = 1
    indicates the feature is active. This bit may not be written by software; it
    reflects the state of the digital thermal sensor.
 * PKG Thermal Status Log (bit 1):
    This is a sticky bit that indicates the history of the thermal sensor high
    temperature output signal (PROCHOT#) of the package. Bit 1 = 1 if package

    this bit by writing a zero.
 * PKG Thermal Threshold #1 Status (bit 6):
    Indicates whether the actual package temperature is currently higher than or
    equal to the value set in Package Thermal Threshold #1. If bit 6 = 0, the

    Indicates whether actual package temperature is currently higher than or
    equal to the value set in Package Thermal Threshold #2. If bit 8 = 0, the
    actual temperature is lower. If bit 8 = 1, the actual temperature is greater
    than or equal to PTT#2. Quantitative information of actual temperature can
    be inferred from Package Digital Readout, bits 22:16.

    by writing a zero.
 * PKG Power Limit Notification Status (bit 10):
    Indicates package power limit is forcing one ore more processors to operate
    below OS-requested P-state. Note that package power limit violation may be
    caused by processor cores or by devices residing in the uncore. Software can
    examine IA32_THERM_STATUS to determine if the cause originates from a
    processor core.
 * PKG Power Limit Notification Log (bit 11):
    Sticky bit that indicates any processor in the package went below
    OS-requested P-state or OS-requested clock modulation duty cycle since the
    last clearing of this or RESET.

 * IA32_PERF_CTL register *****************************************************
 * Performance Control MSR (R/W) Software makes a request for a new Performance

 * operating point can be read from IA32_PERF_STATUS. IA32_PERF_STATUS is
 * updated dynamically. The 16-bit encoding that defines valid operating points
 * is model-specific. Applications and performance tools are not expected to use

    and SMI interrupts are not intercepted in SVM.
 * Reserved (bits 2:1)
 * TlbCacheDis: TLB cache dissable (bit 3):
    1 = Disable performance improvement that assumes that the PML4, PDP, PDE and
    PTE entries are in cacheable WB DRAM.
    Operating systems that maintain page tables in any other memory type must
    set the TlbCacheDis bit to insure proper operation. TlbCacheDis does not
    override the memory type specified by the SMM ASeg and TSeg memory regions
    controlled by Core::X86::Msr::SMMAddr Core::X86::Msr::SMMMask.
 * INVDWBINVD: INVD to WBINVD conversion (bit 4):
    1 = Convert INVD to WBINVD.
    This bit is required to be set for normal operation when any of the

    Core::X86::Cpuid::FeatureExtIdEcx[MwaitExtended].
 * MonMwaitUserEn: MONITOR/MWAIT user mode enable (bit 10):
    0 = The MONITOR and MWAIT instructions are supported only in privilege level
    0; these instructions in privilege levels 1 to 3 cause a #UD exception.
    1 = The MONITOR and MWAIT instructions are supported in all privilege
    levels.
    The state of this bit is ignored if MonMwaitDis is set.
 * Reserved (bits 12:11)

    1 = Disable 32-bit address wrapping.
    Software can use Wrap32Dis to access physical memory above 4 Gbytes without

    it would address +/-2 Gbytes from one of those bases using normal memory
    reference instructions with a FS or GS override prefix. However, the INVLPG,
    FST, and SSE store instructions generate 32-bit addresses in legacy mode,
    regardless of the state of Wrap32Dis.
 * McStatusWrEn: Machine check status write enable (bit 18):
    0 = MCA_STATUS registers are readable; writing a non-zero pattern to these
    registers causes a general protection fault.
    1 = MCA_STATUS registers are Read-write, including Reserved fields; do not
    cause general protection faults; such Writes update all implemented bits in
    these registers; All fields of all threshold registers are Read-write when
    accessed from MSR space, including Locked, except BlkPtr which is always
    Read-only;
    Does not change the access type for the thresholding registers accessed via
    configuration space.

    settings.
 * Reserved (bit 19)
 * IoCfgGpFault: IO-space configuration causes a GP fault (bit 20):
    1=IO-space accesses to configuration space cause a GP fault. The fault is
    triggered if any part of the IO Read/Rrite address range is between CF8h and
    CFFh, inclusive. These faults only result from single IO instructions, not
    to string and REP IO instructions. This fault takes priority over the IO
    trap mechanism described by Core::X86::Msr::SMI_ON_IO_TRAP_CTL_STS.
 * LockTscToCurrentP0: Lock the TSC to the current P0 frequency (bit 21):
    0 = The TSC will count at the P0 frequency.

    P-state.
 * EffFreqCntMwait: Effective frequency counting during mwait (bit 26):
    0 = The registers do not increment.
    1 = The registers increment.
    Specifies whether Core::X86::Msr::MPERF and Core::X86::Msr::APERF increment
    while the core is in the monitor event pending state.
