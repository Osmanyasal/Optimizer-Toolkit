\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Cross Platform Performance Ecosystem mainly developed for Linux and Mac\+OS environments.~\newline

\item {\bfseries{Utilizes}} all advantageous features of {\bfseries{PAPI, Linux Perf, Intel Vtune/\+Advisor, and AMD u\+Prof profilers into a single, unified platform}} by harnessing the code and binary instrumentation techniques while providing a straightforward but elegant GUI for advanced in-\/ and post-\/development monitoring.
\item {\bfseries{100\% CPU agnostic profiling}}
\item Provides {\bfseries{100\% accuracy}} thanks to code-\/line instrumentation.
\item {\bfseries{An Intuitive Programming API for in-\/development monitoring support}}
\item Supports diverse PMU monitoring with {\bfseries{0 learning curve}}.
\item {\bfseries{Bottleneck detection in any phase of the development.}}
\item {\bfseries{Overhead is very very low}} and upto the programmer itself.
\item Python binding. Yes, youâ€™ll have full Python support in code-\/line instrumentation.
\item Developed with C++ and Make/\+Bash scripts.
\item {\bfseries{You can monitor any executable file}}
\item {\bfseries{Use in your c++ and python projects}}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Recursion Optimizer Toolkit gives you an API that you can use in your C++ and Python projects to monitor Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) events in your CPU.~\newline

\item With the help of RAII, you can monitor any pmu events including (cycles, instruction count, LXX cache hits/misses) or use cases including (microarchitecture analysis, energy-\/consumption analysis, thread interaction monitoring, etc.)
\item API can also draw charts as your program is being run for live monitoring

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Recursion Optimizer Toolkit also gives you a total GUI to perform post-\/mortem analysis on {\ttfamily any} executable.
\item The binary executable does {\ttfamily NOT} need to be written with Recursion Optimizer Toolkit API.
\item It simply injects API code into binary executable via static and dynamic binary instrumentation with the Intel PIN tool.
\item User can monitor any method in the executable, all monitoring in API is available here as well.
